# myPortfolio
My official portfolio in the making. I'm working on a single-page portfolio to briefly introduce myself and present
an example of something else I've been working on. My intent is to host it upon completion and link it to my
freelance profiles as well as allow potential clients to contact me by filling a form sent to my inbox via SMTP.
The form will overlay the screen when you click the contact class holding a monster icon. Those features will
start development closer to the end of this process.

Feedback is always appreciated.
